Simple α, β, and γ sensitive Geiger counter, complete with microcontroller (Arduino Nano v3 or clone), 3-button interface, and 128 x 32 I2C OLED. The Geiger tube LDN712 or the ZP1400 can be used as they have similar specs and both have an end window for α-radiation. It displays cps, cpm, or µSv/h. The piezo buzzer emits the legendary “click” with every pulse. The LED (pin 13) also flashes. When assembling the PCB, you should be familiar with SMD components. It is best to order a stencil with the PCB. The 500 V are harmless but still unpleasant, so do not touch the top or bottom of the PCB in the area of the tube. In the following video, I show not only the construction but also freely available radioactive materials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz30onfQ6RM
